#CHANGES:

No build tool is configured yet. Please note this means you must go into the .ts files and save them in Atom after atom-typescript is installed, or run tsc in each of the directories.

A simple script to do that can be run with`./scripts/build.sh` (once, or every time if not in Atom).

To run use `./scripts/test.sh`
